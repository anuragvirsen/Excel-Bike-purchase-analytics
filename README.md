## 🔹 Process  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and standardized categorical values  
   - Created **age groups** (Adolescent, Middle Age, Older) for segmentation  
   - Handled formatting and inconsistencies  

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Used **pivot tables** and formulas to explore trends  
   - Examined relationships between **income, commute distance, age, and purchase decisions**  
   - Applied slicers for filtering across gender, region, and occupation  

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Built an **interactive dashboard** with pivot charts, slicers, and conditional formatting  
   - Designed visuals to quickly answer questions like:  
     - Do higher incomes correlate with more bike purchases?  
     - How does commute distance affect bike ownership?  
     - Which age groups are more likely to purchase bikes?

- **Commute distance** strongly influences purchase behavior  
- **Middle-aged customers** show the strongest buying trends  
- Filters (region, gender, occupation) provide deeper segmentation
